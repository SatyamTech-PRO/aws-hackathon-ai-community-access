# Project Requirements

## Problem Statement
Many communities and small businesses operate in low-bandwidth or unreliable
internet environments, making it difficult for them to access digital services,
information, and opportunities. Existing AI assistants often require stable
connectivity, high data usage, and English-centric interfaces, limiting their
reach and impact.

## Objective
To build a low-bandwidth, AI-powered conversational assistant that enables users
to access essential information, services, and opportunities through text or
voice, even in low-connectivity environments.

## Key Features
- Low-bandwidth optimized AI chatbot
- Text-first and optional voice-based interaction
- Support for local and regional languages
- Query handling for services, programs, and opportunities
- Simple and accessible user interface

## Target Users
- Rural and semi-urban communities
- Small business owners and sellers
- First-time digital users
- Public service beneficiaries

## Functional Requirements
- Handle user queries efficiently with minimal data usage
- Provide accurate and relevant responses
- Support asynchronous or cached responses
- Enable multilingual interaction

## Non-Functional Requirements
- High availability
- Low latency under constrained networks
- Secure data handling
- Scalable architecture

## Constraints
- Limited bandwidth
- Low-end user devices
- Time-bound development for hackathon
